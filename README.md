# 211-project by Tanya Li, Sean Reth, and Alexandria Sampalis

## Summary
### Project Description:
This project allows you to keep track of your grade in URI's CSC 212 class! Not only does it allow you to see what your current grade is in the course, but you can ask it to return specific assigment grades, total grades of a certain category (labs, assignments, ect), prints out all grades in a certain category, and prints out all of your grades int the class. You can also directly change your grade file from this program. This is all done by following very simple accessible instructions within your IDE.

### Project Structure:
This project is broken up into 3 sections, a main.cpp that makes the project interactive, the gradebook.cpp that stores all the functions to make the program run, and lastly the gradebook.h that stores all function declarations. 
Of course you will also need your starter txt file (a template for this can be found below).
the following figure will show you what to expect when the gradebook is up and running.
